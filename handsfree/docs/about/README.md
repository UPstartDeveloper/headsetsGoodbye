# About Handsfree.js.org

## Master Plan

1. Create a library that makes face, hand, eye, and pose tracking and voice and mind control easy to use 
2. Use the library to build a repository of custom handsfree plugins, components, and gestures
3. Use the repository to seed a "user script manager" to power a handsfree browser extension
4. Grow a community of handsfree users and developers around the library and repository
5. Start "The Handsfree Foundation" to promote creative expression

## Changelog

<div class="next-element-is-changelog"></div>

| Date | Version | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| 2020-02-18 | 8.4.0 | Removes the MediaPipe Holistic model. The holistic model is essentially the same as running [Hands](/ref/model/hands/), [Facemesh](/ref/model/facemesh/), and [Pose](/ref/model/pose/) together, although because the holistic data is structured differently (despite using the same models) it led to a lot of confusion and was incompatible with plugins.
| 2020-02-06 | 8.3.0 | Adds basic gesture support through the [Gesture Creator](/create-gesture/). This is still mostly undocumented
| 2020-01-28 | 8.2.6 | Adds `handsfree.data.hands.landmarks` and `handsfree.data.hands.landmarksVisible` to [MediaPipe Hands](/ref/model/hands/), which contain the landmarks for each hand in specific indexes:<br>`.landmarks[0] === Left Hand, Person #1`<br>`.landmarks[1] === Right Hand, Person #1`<br>`.landmarks[2] === Left Hand, Person #2`<br>`.landmarks[3] === Right Hand, Person #2`
| 2020-01-27 | 8.2.4 | Improved the [pinchScroll plugin](/ref/plugin/pinchScroll/) so that it continuously scrolls (instead of having to release and pinch again); `.handsfree-started` is added to body of a [client install](http://localhost:8080/ref/prop/config.html#isclient) (useful in Browser Extensions); merges the [Handsfree Browser Extension](/extension/) to improve iteration feedback cycle (not documented yet); disabling the last active model turns off the camera; fixes a few [Weboji](/ref/model/weboji/) bugs that prevented it from working with other models
| 2020-01-25 | 8.2.3 | [palmPointers plugin](/ref/plugin/palmPointers/) and [faceClick](/ref/plugin/faceClick/) now emit `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mousedrag`, and `mouseup` instead of just `click`
| 2020-01-18 | 8.2.2 | Adds new [palmPointers plugin](/ref/plugin/palmPointers/) and updates the [pinchScroll plugin](/ref/plugin/pinchScroll/) to support all hands. Also adds a new `/boilerplate/cdn/pinch-scrolling.html`
| 2020-01-13 | 8.2.1 | Adds new [normalized helper](/ref/model/handpose/#data): `handsfree.data.handpose.normalized`. These `[x, y, z]` are similar to `.handpose.landmarks` but normalized between [0, 1]
| 2020-01-06 | 8.2.0 | Adds [TensorFlow Handpose](/ref/model/handpose/) including a basic THREE boilerplate remixed from [@LingDong-'s handpose-facemesh-demos](https://github.com/LingDong-/handpose-facemesh-demos), and a fingertip raycaster
| 2020-01-01 | 8.1.2 | Fixes [Face Pointer](/ref/plugin/facePointer/) offsets, which was causing the pointer to assume you were facing straight up ðŸ˜†
| 2020-12-31 | 8.1.1 | Adds [pinchers Plugin](/ref/plugin/pinchers/) for easily working with finger pinches through events, new properties, and styles
| 2020-12-30 | 8.1.0 | Adds [.showDebugger()](/ref/method/showDebugger/), [.hideDebugger()](/ref/method/hideDebugger/), and helper classes. Renames `feedback` to `debugger`
| 2020-12-29 | 8.0.10 | Fixes a bug where `handsfree.debug.$video` had 0 width and height; Fixed issue where the webcam feed was not showing behind model wireframes when `handsfree.config.showDebug === true`
| 2020-12-28 | 8.0.9 | Adds [isClient Mode](/ref/prop/config#isclient) for remote inference. [.runPlugins()](/ref/method/runPlugins/) [.TweenMax()](/ref/method/TweenMax/), [.throttle()](/ref/method/throttle/), reduced filesize by 80kb+
| 2020-12-22 | 8.0.7 | Adds [handsfree.model.weboji.isDetected](/ref/model/weboji/)
