# ðŸ”Œ Plugins and the main loop

When you run [handsfree.start(callback)](/ref/method/start/) a loop is started that does 4 things:

1. Synchronously updates all models and stores their data in `handsfree.model[modelName].data`
2. Triggers a `handsfree-data` event on the `document` with an object containing all the data
3. Runs all active plugins stored in `handsfree.plugin[pluginName]`
4. Runs the callback after all models have been loaded

"Plugins" are the recommended way of working with Handsfree. All enabled plugins run their logic on every frame, can be attached to specific models, toggled on/off by tag, and can even manipulate your `handsfree` instance and other plugins.

## Basic plugins

Basic plugins are created with [handsfree.use(pluginName, callback)](/ref/method/use/):

```js
// A plugin that console logs your data on every frame
handsfree.use('consoleLogger', (data) => {
  console.log(data.weboji.rotation, data.pose.data.faceLandmarks)
})
```

The above will create a new plugin that can now be accessed with `handsfree.plugin.consoleLogger` and will be run on every frame. The callback is stored in `handsfree.plugin.consoleLogger.onFrame`, and you can toggle the plugin with:

```js
handsfree.plugin.consoleLogger.enable()
handsfree.plugin.consoleLogger.disable()
```

The callback receives a `data` object containing the data of every enabled model. It's common to simply destructure the model that you need:

```js
// A plugin that console logs your data on every frame
handsfree.use('consoleLogger', ({weboji}) => {
  console.log(weboji.rotation, weboji.translation, weboji.morphs)
})
```

## Complex plugins

Instead of passing a function you can pass an object into [handsfree.use(pluginName, opts)](/ref/method/use/). `opts` can contain anything, but the following lists special properties and methods:

```js
handsfree.use('pluginName', {
  // Whether the plugin is enabled or not
  // - If omitted, this will default to true
  enabled: true,

  // A list of strings that can be used to toggle this plugin on/off (see below)
  tags: [],

  // A set of config values that can be overwritten
  // - These can be set during instantiation (see below)
  config: {},

  // Called on every frame
  // - If you only pass a callback, it'll get assigned to this method
  onFrame (data) {},

  // Called immediate after this plugin is added (whether it's enabled or not)
  // - Use this for any setup, like creating DOM elements
  onUse (handsfree) {},

  // Called when the plugin is enabled from a disabled state
  // - eg, after calling: handsfree.plugin.myPlugin.enable()
  onEnable (handsfree) {},

  // Called when the plugin is disabled from an enabled state
  // - eg, after calling: handsfree.plugin.myPlugin.disable()
  onDisable (handsfree) {}
})
```

Since the basic plugin above simply maps the callback to an `onFrame` method, another way of writing it is:

```js
handsfree.use('consoleLogger', {
  onFrame (data) {
    console.log(weboji.rotation, weboji.translation, weboji.morphs)
  }
})
```

The `onEnable` and `onDisable` methods makes it easy to run code when you run `.enable()` or `.disable()` on the plugin. A common use case is to show/hide DOM elements (for example, to toggle the face and palm pointers).

You can add tags to the plugin through the `.tags` prop to bulk disable/enable plugins with the [handsfree.enablePlugins(tags)](/ref/method/enablePlugins/) and [handsfree.disablePlugins(tags)](/ref/method/disablePlugins/). `.tags` can be a string or array of strings:

```js
handsfree.use('consoleLogger', {
  // This can be a string or array of strings
  tags: ['debugging'],
  onFrame (data) {
    console.log(data)
  }
})

// Toggle the core "browser" plugins that come with Handsfree.js
// - These help you use webpages handsfree
// - Note that the consoleLogger will still be active since it doesn't have a browser tag
handsfree.enablePlugins('browser')
handsfree.disablePlugins('browser')
```

Calling these methods without tags enables or disables all the plugins. This provides a powerful way to swap out plugins based on the route:

```js
// Disable all the plugins
handsfree.disablePlugins()
// Enable only the plugins for the current route
handsfree.enablePlugins('homepage')
```

> **Note:** `.onEnable()` is only called when you run `handsfree.plugin[pluginName].enable()`. It doesn't run immediately when you `.use()` the plugin even if `.enabled === true`. Use `onUse()` instead. 

## Accessing data outside of a plugin

You may occasionally find yourself in a part of your app where you don't have easy access to your `handsfree` instance. In these cases, you can still access the data on every frame by listening to the `handsfree-data` event on the `document`:

```js
document.addEventListener('handsfree-data', (event) => {
  console.log(event.detail.weboji.rotation, event.detail.weboji.translation)
})
```

## Checking your data

Because you have the ability to swap out models and configs on the fly, it's highly recommended to first check that the model has data. Due to the synchronous way that data is received it's possible that the data is not present the frame immediately after enabling the plugin:

```js
handfree.use('consoleLogger', (data) => {
  if (!data.weboji) return

  console.log(data.weboji)
})
```

## Updating plugins through instantiation or `handsfree.update()`

You can set plugins during instantiation through the `plugin` property. Set the plugin name to true to use defaults:

```js
handsfree = new Handsfree({
  hands: true,
  plugin: {
    // Enable with defaults
    pinchScroll: true
  }
})
```

Or pass a config object to pre-configure it:

```js
handsfree = new Handsfree({
  hands: true,
  plugin: {
    pinchScroll: {
      enabled: true,
      speed: 1
    }
  }
})
```

You can do the same with the [handsfree.update()](/ref/method/update/) method:

```js
handsfree.update({
  plugin: {
    pinchScroll: true
  }
})
```
