# âš¡ Events

You can listen to each of the following on the document. Because these are events the data will be in `event.detail`:

```js
// Listen on the document...
document.addEventListener('handsfree-data', event => {
  console.log(event.detail)
})

// ...or through the .on() method (without the 'handsfree-' prefix)
handsfree.on('data', ({detail}) => {
  console.log(detail)
})
```
